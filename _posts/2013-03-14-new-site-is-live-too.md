title: New site is still live!
---

I've finally gotten around to spinning up a new site using Jekyll and (probably)
Amazon S3. We'll see how this goes. I'm pretty pleased with Jekyll so far, though.
Attempted to use SCSS, but now might not be the time to do that. This font rocks,
though. How many words is 75, anyways? That seems like a lot. Let's start truncating
and we'll see how things look after that. Still no? Goddamn. That's a lot of words
of just straight bullshit.
